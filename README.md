# HuffmanCoding-Encoding

This project is an implementation of the Huffman Algorithm using a min heap (priority queue) and basic file reading and writing.

## Overview

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to use a variable-length code table for encoding a source symbol (such as a character in a file) where the variable-length code table has been derived in a particular way based on the estimated probability of occurrence for each possible value of the source symbol.

## Features

- **Encoding**: Compress text files using Huffman coding.
- **Decoding**: Decompress Huffman-encoded files to restore the original content.
- **File Handling**: Read input files for encoding and write encoded/decoded content to output files.

## How It Works

1. **Build Frequency Table**: Calculate the frequency of each character in the input file.
2. **Build Huffman Tree**: Use a min heap (priority queue) to build the Huffman tree based on character frequencies.
3. **Generate Codes**: Traverse the Huffman tree to generate variable-length codes for each character.
4. **Encode**: Replace each character in the input file with its corresponding Huffman code.
5. **Decode**: Convert the encoded file back to the original content using the Huffman tree.
